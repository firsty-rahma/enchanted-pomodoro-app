# Enchanted Simple Pomodoro App
## Description
This project is an 'enchantment' of the previous Simple Pomodoro project, which is a further development of a [tutorial](https://freshman.tech/pomodoro-timer/). This project is still on development.
## Current Main Features
- Timer Display with Full Controls
- Sound Notifications
- Saving Task List
- Long Breaks After Multiple Pomodoros
## Technologies used
I used Vite for building this app, although I used Vanilla JS for making this app. Besides that, I am using LocalStorage for saving the task data in the browser. I want to use Node.js to manage the task data. Unfortunately, I did not find a way to connect Node.js and LocalStorage API.
## Installation
Since I do not deploy this app yet, I give some instruction to operate this app:
1. Clone this repo to your local folder
2. Open your terminal and go to this project folder
3. Type `npm run dev` at the terminal and run the command
4. Click the localhost link and the app is ready to use
## Future Development
- Adding some new features
  * Priority Task
  * Visual Representation
  * Productivity Stats
- Improving task list
- Using Node.js for the CRUD operation
